# S14 â€” Updates & configuration

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S14

## Goal
Lock update verification and configuration precedence across surfaces.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage catalog updated).
- Gallery dedupe audit produced (CI emits `artifacts/gallery_dedupe_audit.json` summarising duplicates removed / reviewed).
- Evidence ledger updated with gallery audit context (stage ledger + gate summary include S14 record).

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/gallery_dedupe_audit.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S14): Checks signed update flow and configuration precedence ordering.

## Ownership
- @yourorg/pm-team @yourorg/eng-leads (@yourorg/qa where applicable)
