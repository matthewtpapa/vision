# S04 — Real detector (YOLO)

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S04

## Goal
Ship the YOLO detector with reproducible performance and bounding-box stability.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage list aligned).
- Detector recall and coverage meet the investor baseline (candidate recall ≥ **0.45** on `artifacts/oracle_bench.json`).
- Latency p95 ≤ **12.0** ms @**720p** captured in `artifacts/oracle_bench.json`.
- Evidence ledger updated with detector bench context (non-empty `gate_summary.txt` + ledger entries).

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/oracle_fixture.jsonl
- artifacts/oracle_bench.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S04): Checks detector latency, mAP target, and bounding-box stability diffs.
