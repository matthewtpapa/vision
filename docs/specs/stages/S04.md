# S04 — Real detector (YOLO)

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S04

## Goal
Ship the YOLO detector with reproducible performance and bounding-box stability.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Per-frame p95 ≤ **12.0** ms @**720p**; mAP@**0.5** ≥ **0.45**; boxes stable within **1e-6** across runs.

## Evidence artifacts
- bench/oracle_stats.json
- (TODO) Detector mAP audit
- (TODO) Bounding-box stability diff

## CI checks
- SoT-Check (S04): Checks detector latency, mAP target, and bounding-box stability diffs.

## Ownership
- @yourorg/pm-team @yourorg/eng-leads (@yourorg/qa where applicable)
