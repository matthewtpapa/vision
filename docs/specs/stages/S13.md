- Evidence ledger updated with configuration precedence summary (stage ledger + gate summary include S13 entry).

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/config_precedence.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S13): Verifies diagnostics coverage and wheel reproducibility metadata.
