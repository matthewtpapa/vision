# S08 â€” Fusion learner

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S08

## Goal
Train and serialize the fusion learner with provenance-backed weights.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage catalog updated).
- CI hygiene matrix recorded in `artifacts/ci_matrix_summary.json` and shows all required platforms exercised/uploaded.

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/ci_matrix_summary.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S08): Checks fusion recall, latency, and weight serialization provenance.
