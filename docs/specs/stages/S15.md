# S15 â€” Demo & assets

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S15

## Goal
Publish deterministic demo assets with documented rights.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage catalog updated).
- Promotion thresholds satisfied with documented JSON report (CI enforces gates before release promotion).
- Ledger tip recomputed and matches `artifacts/ledger_tip.txt` to prove append-only EvidenceLedger.

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/promotion_report.json
- artifacts/ledger_tip.txt
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S15): Verifies demo determinism, rights documentation, and asset manifest checks.

## Ownership
- @yourorg/pm-team @yourorg/eng-leads (@yourorg/qa where applicable)
