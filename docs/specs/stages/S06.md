# S06 — Caption → Linker

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S06

## Goal
Wire caption outputs into linker candidates with documented variance controls.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Candidate recall ≥ **0.85**; ≤ **3** candidates per span; output variance within documented tolerance.

## Evidence artifacts
- (TODO) Caption-linker recall report
- (TODO) Span candidate count audit

## CI checks
- SoT-Check (S06): Checks linker recall, candidate count limits, and variance documentation.

## Ownership
- @yourorg/pm-team @yourorg/eng-leads (@yourorg/qa where applicable)
