# S12 â€” SDK surface & CLIs

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S12

## Goal
Freeze the SDK interface and CLI flows with example coverage.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage catalog updated).
- Public API freeze report generated and clean (CI verifies exported surface in `artifacts/public_api_report.json`).
- Evidence ledger updated with API freeze outcome (stage ledger + gate summary include S12 entry).

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/public_api_report.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S12): Checks API freeze status, CLI contract enforcement, and example coverage.
