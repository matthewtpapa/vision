# S09 — E2E with real models

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S09

## Goal
Demonstrate the full pipeline with real models and stable evidence hashes.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- p@1 ≥ **0.80**; e2e p95 ≤ **33** ms; unknown FA ≤ **2.5**%; decode/crop/timing hashes identical across two CI runs; tracker OFF.

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/metrics_summary.json
- artifacts/metrics_run1.json
- artifacts/metrics_run2.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl

## CI checks
- SoT-Check (S09): Validates end-to-end metrics, hash parity, and tracker disablement.

## Ownership
