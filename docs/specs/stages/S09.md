# S09 â€” E2E with real models

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S09

## Goal
Demonstrate the full pipeline with real models and stable evidence hashes.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage catalog updated).
- Purity guard reports zero offenders and no network syscalls (`artifacts/purity_report.json`).
- SBOM + licenses inventories present and validated (non-empty `artifacts/sbom.json` and `artifacts/licenses.json`).
- Evidence ledger updated with supply-chain posture (stage ledger + gate summary include S09 entry).

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/purity_report.json
- artifacts/sbom.json
- artifacts/licenses.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S09): Validates end-to-end metrics, hash parity, and tracker disablement.
