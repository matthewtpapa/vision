# S11 â€” Platforms & parity

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S11

## Goal
Validate cross-platform parity across Ubuntu, Orin, and Android under deterministic guards.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage catalog updated).
- Promotion thresholds (P@1 / coverage) pass with documented summary in `artifacts/promotion_report.json`.
- Evidence ledger records the promotion decision (stage ledger + gate summary include S11 record).

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/promotion_report.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S11): Verifies platform latency targets, parity tolerances, and purity checks.
