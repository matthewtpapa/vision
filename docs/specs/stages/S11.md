## Goal
Validate cross-platform parity across Ubuntu, Orin, and Android under deterministic guards.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Ubuntu, Orin, Android meet e2e p95 ≤ **33** ms; output parity within documented tolerances; purity green on each.

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/purity_report.json
- (TODO) Platform parity comparison

## CI checks
- SoT-Check (S11): Verifies platform latency targets, parity tolerances, and purity checks.

## Ownership
