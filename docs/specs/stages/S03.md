# S03 — Real embedder (CLIP)

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S03

## Goal
Integrate the production CLIP embedder with reproducible stability and licensing readiness.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (no drift in tracked files, stage catalog updated).
- Metrics determinism holds (twin `metrics_hash_run*.txt` digests match and consolidate into `artifacts/metrics_hash.txt`).
- Embedder accuracy and latency stay within investor bounds (recall ≥ **0.95**, p@1 ≥ **0.80**, p95 ≤ **8.0** ms captured in `artifacts/metrics_summary.json`).
- Evidence ledger updated with calibration proof (non-empty `logs/evidence_ledger.jsonl`).

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/metrics_summary.json
- artifacts/metrics_hash.txt
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- logs/evidence_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S03): Verifies embedder latency, cross-run stability, and licensing attestation.
