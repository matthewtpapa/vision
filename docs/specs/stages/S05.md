# S05 â€” Deterministic cropper

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S05

## Goal
Lock a deterministic cropper pipeline with reproducible pixel outputs.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage catalog updated).
- Promotion wiring produces deterministic review output (promotion report JSON + JSONL rendered with stable hashes).
- Promotion thresholds met (CI asserts P@1 / coverage gates before emitting the promotion report).
- Evidence ledger updated for verifier chain (stage ledger + gate summary include S05 decision record).

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/promotion_report.json
- artifacts/promotion_report.jsonl
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S05): Validates cropper policy settings, latency, and byte-for-byte determinism.
