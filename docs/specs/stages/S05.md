# S05 — Deterministic cropper

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S05

## Goal
Lock a deterministic cropper pipeline with reproducible pixel outputs.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Policy: **10%** expand, **256×256**, fixed padding, bilinear, single BGR→RGB; cropper p95 ≤ **1.2** ms; crop bytes identical across runs.

## Evidence artifacts
- (TODO) Cropper policy snapshot
- (TODO) Crop bytes checksum manifest

## CI checks
- SoT-Check (S05): Validates cropper policy settings, latency, and byte-for-byte determinism.

## Ownership
- @yourorg/pm-team @yourorg/eng-leads (@yourorg/qa where applicable)
