# S10 — Footprint & scale

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S10

## Goal
Constrain runtime footprint and scale characteristics for large knowledge bases.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Cold-start ≤ **1.1** s; memory ≤ **400** MB @ **1M** IDs; shard manifest & order locked.

## Evidence artifacts
- (TODO) Footprint profile report
- (TODO) Memory scale log

## CI checks
- verify (S10): Checks cold-start, memory profile, and shard manifest ordering.

## Ownership
- @yourorg/pm-team @yourorg/eng-leads (@yourorg/qa where applicable)
