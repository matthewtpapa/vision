# S10 — Footprint & scale

**From SoT:** docs/Vision_v1_Investor_SoT.html#S10

## Goal
Constrain runtime footprint and scale characteristics for large knowledge bases.

## Acceptance (CI-verified)
- Roadmap lock passes (tracked fileset fingerprint unchanged, stage catalog updated).
- LabelBank scale bench meets recall guardrails (`artifacts/labelbank_scale_bench.json` shows recall ≥ investor target).
- Latency p95 stays within scale budget recorded in `artifacts/labelbank_scale_bench.json`.

## Evidence artifacts
- artifacts/labelbank_scale_bench.json
- artifacts/stage_ledger.jsonl
- gate_summary.txt

## CI checks
- verify (S10): Checks cold-start, memory profile, and shard manifest ordering.

## Ownership
- @yourorg/pm-team @yourorg/eng-leads (@yourorg/qa where applicable)
