# Contributing

We welcome small, focused pull requests.

## Getting Started
- Create a virtual environment and install the package in editable mode.
- Run tests with `pytest` before submitting.
- Exercise the CLI dry-run via `vision webcam --use-fake-detector --dry-run`.
- External network calls (RIS) are deferred until future milestones.
